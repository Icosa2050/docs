This repository:  

- temporarily acts as a "documentation as code" hub for all the notes submitted by Plutus community collaborators, and make them
available via HTML at:

<https://plutus-community.readthedocs.io/>

- It is expected to be eventually replaced by a repository under IOG control. 

- It is built over the great work done by Nikolay Stankov and all the cohort 01 students that shared their
notes using the following resources (that don't seem to be maintained any longer):

<https://github.com/nstankov-bg/docs.plutus-community.com>
